I am an Assistant Professor in the [School of Aerospace Engineering at Georgia Tech](https://ae.gatech.edu/). I lead the [Luâ€™s Navigation and Autonomous Robotics (Lunar) Lab](https://sites.gatech.edu/lunarlab/), and I am also on the core faculty of the [Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Machines (IRIM)](https://research.gatech.edu/robotics) at Georgia Tech.

Before joining Georgia Tech, I had a two-year Postdoc appointment at the Graduate Aerospace Laboratories of the California Institute of Technology ([GALCIT](https://galcit.caltech.edu/)), working with Prof. [Soon-Jo Chung](https://galcit.caltech.edu/people/sjchung) and Prof. [Yisong Yue](http://www.yisongyue.com/). I completed my Ph.D. in Robotics in 2022 from the [Robotics Institute](https://robotics.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan (UM), advised by Prof. [Ryan Eustice](http://robots.engin.umich.edu/~ryan/), Prof. [Jessy Grizzle](https://ece.umich.edu/faculty/grizzle/) and Prof. [Maani Ghaffari](https://curly.engin.umich.edu/people#h.7jd25w55csv). I worked as a member of the Perceptual Robotics Laboratory ([PeRL](http://robots.engin.umich.edu/)), the Computational Autonomy and Robotics Laboratory ([CURLY](https://curly.engin.umich.edu/)), and the [Bipedal Robotics lab](https://www.biped.solutions/) at UM.

I am broadly interested in Robotics, Computer Vision and Machine Learning. Specifically, my research focuses on robot perception, robot learning, and autonomous navigation. My group explores the use of computer vision, machine learning, estimation, probabilistic inference, kinematics and dynamics to develop autonomous systems in ground, air, and space applications.
